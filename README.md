# Redstone Contracts

This repository serves as an auxiliary collection of smart contracts specifically designed to be used within a Foundry development environment. The primary purpose of this repository is to import contracts from the [Redstone Oracles Monorepo](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo) for integration in Foundry as importing all the monorepo contracts would be impractical (and causes build errors).
